Spotify can be controlled with Emacs!!


## What I used? {#what-i-used}

First I installed a package to control spotify from MELPA
<https://github.com/Lautaro-Garcia/counsel-spotify>

-   Just \`M-x package-install counsel-spotify\`

-   Need to [register an application](<https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications>) in spotify.
-   Copy the client id and client secret and set two variables in \`config.el\` (Doom Emacs)

    ```elisp
    (setq counsel-spotify-client-id "")
    (setq counsel-spotify-client-secret "")
    ```

-   Done!.. Now you can control Spotify directly from Emacs!..


## Is that all? {#is-that-all}

If Spotify app is not running counsel-spotify will open it for me, i dislike that .. so I took a look and found <https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd>

A spotify daemon!!.

Since I'm running on Mac I just installed with \`brew\`

```bash
$ brew install spotifyd
```

And then configure it by creating a file inside \`~/.config/spotifyd/spotifyd.conf\`

With the following (is a toml file)

```toml
[global]
# Fill this in with your Spotify login.
username = USERNAME

# You'll be using the macOS keychain to specify your password.
use_keyring = true

# How this machine shows up in Spotify Connect.
device_name = spotifyd
device_type = computer

# This is the default location of Spotify's cache, so just replace LOGIN_NAME
# with your macOS login name (type `whoami` at a Terminal window).
cache_path = /Users/LOGIN_NAME/Library/Application Support/Spotify/PersistentCache/Storage
no_audio_cache = false

# Various playback options. Tweak these if Spotify is too quiet.
bitrate = 320
volume_normalisation = true
normalisation_pregain = -10

# These need to be set, but don't need to be changed.
backend = rodio
mixer = PCM
volume_controller = softvol
zeroconf_port = 1234
```

-   Then I just need to add the password to the keychain

    ```bash
    $ security add-generic-password -s spotifyd -D rust-keyring -a <your username> -w <your password>
    ```

-   Launch the daemon

<!--listend-->

```bash
$ brew services start spotifyd
```

-   Last step is to enable emacs to access the daemeon, configure this in the \`config.el\` (or by using \`M-X describe-variable\` and customize group)

    ```elisp
    (setq counsel-spotify-service-name "spotifyd")

    ```

**Done** Now I can listen <Spotify> without using their [Electron]({{< relref "20201020225023-electron" >}}) app
